Codes written and tested in Python 3.5.1

Tasks 1. and 2. done for the Python Intern. 

Function group_by() is defined in task1.py. Additionally, in file validation_of_data.py
some values that are used in group_by() are printed to check if they are valid. 

Function damage() is defined in task2.py. In file tests_task2.py some test cases are ckecked to see if function works properly.

# Installation

In the task 1. I had used pandas library. If not installed on your computer, it can be installed for example via pip from PyPI by:
```
pip install pandas
```
For more installation ways you can look at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html.
